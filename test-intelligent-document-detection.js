    Comprehensive Clinical Progress Note
    
    Client: Sarah Johnson
    Date: August 10, 2025
    Session Type: Individual Therapy
    Duration: 60 minutes
    
    Subjective:
    Client presented today discussing ongoing anxiety related to work transitions. She reports feeling "overwhelmed" by recent changes in her role and expresses concerns about meeting expectations. Sleep patterns remain disrupted (4-5 hours per night), and she notes increased caffeine intake to compensate for fatigue.
    
    Objective:
    Client appeared alert and engaged throughout the session. Maintained appropriate eye contact. Speech was rapid at times, consistent with reported anxiety. No signs of acute distress observed.
    
    Assessment:
    Client continues to demonstrate symptoms consistent with adjustment disorder with anxiety. Progress noted in identifying trigger patterns, though coping strategies need reinforcement. Client shows good insight into her current challenges.
    
    Plan:
    1. Continue weekly individual therapy sessions
    2. Practice grounding techniques discussed today
    3. Implement sleep hygiene recommendations
    4. Follow up on work-related stressors next session

    Therapist: Good morning, Sarah. How are you feeling today?
    
    Client: Um, honestly, not great. I've been, like, really struggling with work stuff lately. You know how I mentioned last time about the changes at my job?
    
    Therapist: Yes, I remember. Can you tell me more about what's been happening?
    
    Client: Well, so they moved me to a different department, and I just... I don't know if I can handle it. I mean, everyone expects me to know everything right away, but I feel like I'm drowning. And I'm barely sleeping - maybe 4 or 5 hours a night. I keep drinking more coffee just to stay awake.
    
    Therapist: That sounds really challenging. When you say you feel like you're drowning, can you help me understand what that feels like for you?
    
    Client: It's like... you know when you're underwater and you can't breathe? That's how I feel at work. Like I can't catch my breath. And then I come home and I just worry about the next day.
    
    Therapist: I can hear how overwhelming this has been for you. Let's talk about some strategies that might help...

    Session 1 - August 8, 2025
    
    Therapist: How have things been since our last session?
    Client: Better, I think. I tried those breathing exercises you suggested.
    Therapist: That's great to hear. How did they work for you?
    Client: Um, pretty well actually. When I felt that panic starting, I did the 4-4-4 breathing and it helped.

    Clinical Progress Note
    Date: August 12, 2025
    Client: Michael Torres
    
    Subjective: Client reports significant improvement in anxiety symptoms following implementation of breathing techniques. States "I feel more in control now."
    
    Objective: Client appeared relaxed and spoke with normal pace. Demonstrated proper breathing technique when prompted.
    
    Assessment: Positive response to behavioral interventions. Anxiety symptoms showing marked improvement.
    
    Plan: Continue with current interventions and introduce progressive muscle relaxation next session.
