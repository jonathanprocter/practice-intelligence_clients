Therapy Session Transcripts for Sarah Johnson

Session 1 - August 5, 2025

Patient: Hi Dr. Procter, thanks for seeing me today.
Therapist: Of course, Sarah. How have you been feeling since our last session?
Patient: Well, I've been having those anxiety attacks again, especially at work. It's getting really difficult to concentrate.
Therapist: Can you tell me more about what triggers these attacks?
Patient: It's usually when I have to present to the team or when my manager asks me to take on new projects. My heart starts racing and I feel like I can't breathe.
Therapist: That sounds very distressing. Have you been practicing the breathing exercises we discussed?
Patient: I try to, but sometimes I forget in the moment. When the panic hits, it's hard to think clearly.

Session 2 - August 12, 2025

Patient: Dr. Procter, I had a much better week this time.
Therapist: That's wonderful to hear, Sarah. What made the difference?
Patient: I actually used those breathing techniques during a big presentation on Friday. It really helped me stay calm.
Therapist: Excellent! How did you remember to use them in the moment?
Patient: I wrote a little note on my hand before the meeting. It reminded me to pause and breathe when I felt the anxiety starting.
Therapist: That's a great strategy. How are you sleeping lately?
Patient: Much better actually. I've been getting about 7 hours a night instead of the 4-5 I was getting before.
Therapist: The improved sleep is likely contributing to your better emotional regulation. Let's continue building on these positive changes.

Session 3 - August 19, 2025

Patient: This week was more challenging again.
Therapist: What happened, Sarah?
Patient: My manager gave me a really tight deadline on a project, and I started having those familiar worry spirals about not being good enough.
Therapist: How did you handle those thoughts?
Patient: I tried the cognitive restructuring we practiced. Instead of "I'm going to fail," I told myself "This is challenging, but I have the skills to handle it."
Therapist: That's excellent work. What was the outcome?
Patient: I finished the project on time, and my manager was really pleased with the quality. But I still felt exhausted from all the worry.
Therapist: It's normal to feel tired when you're actively working against anxiety patterns. The important thing is you succeeded both in completing the project and in using your coping skills.
