Session Notes - Ava Moskowitz - August 5, 2025

Client presented today with continued anxiety about social situations and work relationships. She reported having a difficult week with her supervisor at work, feeling like she's "walking on eggshells" and unable to set appropriate boundaries.

Subjective:
Ava reported feeling overwhelmed by work demands and interpersonal conflicts. She stated "I feel like I'm constantly trying to please everyone and it's exhausting." She mentioned having trouble sleeping due to worry about work interactions and fear of confrontation.

Objective:
Client appeared somewhat anxious, fidgeting with her hands during session. Speech was rapid at times when discussing work stressors. Good eye contact maintained throughout session. Client was engaged and cooperative.

Assessment:
Ava continues to struggle with boundary setting and assertiveness in professional relationships. Her people-pleasing behaviors appear to be increasing anxiety and affecting sleep. She would benefit from continued work on assertiveness skills and cognitive restructuring around conflict avoidance.

Plan:
1. Continue CBT techniques for anxiety management
2. Practice assertiveness exercises for workplace situations
3. Homework: Complete thought record for work-related anxiety triggers
4. Schedule follow-up in one week
5. Consider referral to psychiatrist if sleep issues persist

Client expressed motivation to work on these areas and scheduled next appointment for August 12, 2025.
