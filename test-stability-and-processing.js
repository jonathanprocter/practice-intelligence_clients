COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL PROGRESS NOTE

Subject: Caitlin Dunn
Date: August 8, 2025
Session Duration: 50 minutes

SUBJECTIVE:
Client presented with continued challenges around anxiety management and work-related stress. She reported having three panic episodes this week, primarily triggered by upcoming project deadlines at work. Client noted improved sleep patterns compared to last session, averaging 6-7 hours per night. She expressed frustration with recurring negative thought patterns and requested additional coping strategies.

OBJECTIVE:
Client appeared alert and cooperative throughout the session. Maintained appropriate eye contact and engaged actively in therapeutic discussion. Exhibited mild fidgeting during anxiety-related topics but demonstrated good self-awareness of these behaviors. Completed anxiety assessment (GAD-7 score: 12, indicating moderate anxiety).

ASSESSMENT:
Client continues to struggle with generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) with work-related stressors as primary triggers. Progress is evident in sleep regulation and self-monitoring of anxiety symptoms. Readiness for learning new coping mechanisms is high. Therapeutic alliance remains strong.

PLAN:
1. Introduce progressive muscle relaxation techniques
2. Assign anxiety journal for trigger identification
3. Schedule follow-up in one week
4. Consider referral for medication evaluation if symptoms persist

Session with Jason Smith - January 20, 2025

Therapist: Good morning Jason, how are you feeling today?

Jason: Um, well, you know, it's been a tough week. I've been having those same thoughts again about not being good enough at work.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what specifically triggered these thoughts this week?

Jason: So, like, my boss gave me this new project on Monday, and I immediately started thinking, um, you know, what if I mess this up? What if everyone realizes I don't know what I'm doing?

Therapist: Those sound like some familiar patterns we've discussed before. How did your body respond when you had these thoughts?

Jason: Yeah, exactly like we talked about. My heart started racing, I got sweaty palms, and I couldn't concentrate on anything else for like an hour.

Therapist: What coping strategies did you try from our previous sessions?

Jason: Well, I tried the breathing thing, you know, the 4-4-4 breathing? It helped a little bit, but not as much as I hoped.

Therapist: That's actually progress that you remembered to use it. Let's explore what might make it more effective for you.

Jason: Okay, yeah, I'm open to that. I really want to get better at managing this anxiety.

Session 1: July 15, 2025 - Sarah Johnson
Therapist: How are you adjusting to the new medication?
Sarah: Much better, the anxiety is more manageable now.

Session 2: July 22, 2025 - Sarah Johnson  
Therapist: Any side effects from the medication this week?
Sarah: Just some mild drowsiness in the mornings.

Session 3: July 29, 2025 - Sarah Johnson
Therapist: Let's review your progress over the past month.
Sarah: I feel like I'm finally getting my life back on track.
