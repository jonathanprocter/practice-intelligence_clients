### Production Build
- Vite builds frontend to `dist/public`
- ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- Environment-based configuration management
- Database migrations via Drizzle Kit

### Environment Configuration
Required environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: For Claude API access
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For GPT API access
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Google Calendar OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Google Calendar OAuth client secret
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment specification

**Google Cloud Console Setup Required:**
- App name: RemarkablePlanner
- JavaScript Origins: https://remarkableplanner.replit.app, https://remarkableplanner.replit.dev, https://be19ccdd-fe98-4120-a41d-5c815c7c7a5e-00-24nxj2b2smggx.picard.replit.dev
- Redirect URIs: https://remarkableplanner.replit.app/api/auth/google/callback, https://remarkableplanner.replit.dev/api/auth/google/callback, https://be19ccdd-fe98-4120-a41d-5c815c7c7a5e-00-24nxj2b2smggx.picard.replit.dev/api/auth/google/callback

**Current Issue (2025-01-31):** Google Calendar OAuth failing because current Replit domain `https://be19ccdd-fe98-4120-a41d-5c815c7c7a5e-00-24nxj2b2smggx.picard.replit.dev` needs to be added to Google Cloud Console authorized redirect URIs.

The system is designed for scalability with serverless-ready architecture and modern deployment practices. The separation of concerns allows for independent scaling of frontend and backend components while maintaining type safety throughout the application.
