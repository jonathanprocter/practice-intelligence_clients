# Automated Application Audit and Fix Workflow

## Comprehensive Audit System

This automated system continuously audits and fixes application issues to maintain 100% stability.

### Audit Categories:
1. **Critical Issues** (10 point penalty each)
   - Server connectivity failures
   - Database connection errors
   - Missing critical files
   - TypeScript compilation errors

2. **High Priority Issues** (5 point penalty each)
   - API endpoint failures
   - Security vulnerabilities (exposed secrets)
   - Missing dependencies
   - Performance issues

3. **Warnings** (1 point penalty each)
   - Code quality issues (console.log statements)
   - Large files
   - Non-critical performance concerns

### Scoring System:
- Base score: 100 points
- Subtract penalties for each issue
- Target: 100/100 score maintained consistently

### Automated Fix Strategies:

#### Security Fixes:
- Identify hardcoded API keys and secrets
- Replace with environment variable references
- Clean up console.log statements in production code

#### Performance Fixes:
- Comment out debug statements
- Identify large files for optimization
- Clean up unnecessary logging

#### TypeScript Fixes:
- Automatic compilation error detection
- Import path validation
- Type definition fixes

### Iterative Improvement:
1. Run comprehensive audit
2. Apply automated fixes
3. Re-audit to measure improvement
4. Repeat until 100% score achieved
5. Maintain score with continuous monitoring

## Current Status:
- Initial audit: 0/100 (151 total issues)
- Post-fix audit: In progress
- Target: 100/100 within 3 iterations
