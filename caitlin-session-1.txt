Comprehensive Clinical Progress Note for Caitlin Dunn’s Therapy Session on June 18, 2025

Subjective

Caitlin attended today’s session via telehealth, initially presenting with a light and somewhat jocular demeanor, greeting the therapist with “fierce, fabulous and fuckable always.” This initial presentation, however, quickly shifted to reveal significant distress. Her primary presenting concern was severe sleep disturbance, which she explicitly linked to her past role as a primary caregiver for her mother and grandmother during their illnesses, stating, “I had to keep my ear open at all times to take care of them and So ever since then, never was able to do it again.” She reported that despite various efforts, including medication (melatonin up to 20mg), reading, and calming music, she still struggles to fall asleep and wakes up feeling “so tired.” This chronic sleep issue has been exacerbated since losing her job, leading to feelings of self-shame (“Why do I do this to myself?”).

Caitlin expressed profound frustration regarding her job search, having applied to “35 jobs in the fashion industry” with no responses. This lack of progress is compounded by intense pressure from her mother, who is “going fucking crazy” and pushing her to pursue interior design, a field Caitlin explicitly dislikes and does not wish to return to. She conveyed feeling overwhelmed by her mother’s constant interference in her career decisions, even resorting to tears before the session. This dynamic extends to her wedding planning, where her mother is actively micromanaging and making unilateral decisions, such as attempting to dictate the wedding shower venue and guest list for the engagement party. Caitlin articulated her desire for autonomy, stating, “I don’t even want people to know I’m fucking married” in reference to her courthouse wedding for insurance purposes, indicating a strong wish for privacy and control over her own narrative. She acknowledged “overthinking all of this” in response to external pressures regarding both her career and wedding.

Further stressors emerged concerning her friend group dynamics. She described feeling “weird” about her friends’ reactions to her separate friendship with Noah, an individual with whom she shares a secure, low-maintenance connection. She also expressed discomfort with a complex friend group dynamic involving a friend, Lara, who has been cut out by the others, leaving Caitlin as the only one who maintains contact, which she finds “fucking awkward.” She also detailed her difficulty setting boundaries with friends who expect invitations to her engagement party, despite not being close. Caitlin articulated a desire to avoid “regrets” and to “do what I want to do,” signaling a yearning for self-determination amidst these pervasive external pressures.

Objective

Caitlin presented via telehealth, appearing well-groomed and appropriately dressed. She was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her speech was initially rapid and animated, particularly when discussing shared frustrations with the therapist regarding sleep, but became more clipped and intense when discussing her mother’s actions. Her affect displayed a fluctuating range, shifting from moments of self-deprecating humor and shared commiseration with the therapist to visible frustration, exasperation, and moments of near tearfulness when detailing her mother’s over-involvement and the job search difficulties. Her thought process was logical and coherent, although she acknowledged a tendency towards “overthinking” her social and familial dilemmas. Her body language, though limited by telehealth, conveyed a sense of being overwhelmed, with frequent sighing and expressions of disbelief regarding her mother’s behavior. She actively sought validation from the therapist, frequently asking “right?” or “do you think?” when presenting her perspectives on the various situations.

Assessment

Caitlin is experiencing significant psychological distress primarily driven by external stressors related to her career and upcoming marriage, compounded by her mother’s profound boundary violations. Her chronic sleep disturbance, rooted in past caregiving trauma, is exacerbated by these current stressors, functioning as a physiological manifestation of unmanaged anxiety and hyperarousal. The difficulty in falling asleep and waking up feeling unrefreshed despite pharmacological intervention (melatonin) suggests a deep-seated pattern of physiological dysregulation and a potential for a conditioned fear response related to sleep, stemming from her past caregiving responsibilities. This persistent sleep disturbance significantly impacts her overall functioning and emotional resilience.

The job loss has triggered an acute identity crisis, evident in her mother’s relentless pressure to return to a disliked field (interior design) and Caitlin’s internal struggle to define her professional self. Her expressed desire to “stick to something and stay with it to have a successful career” indicates a strong need for stability and competence, which is currently undermined by the job market and her mother’s interference. This situation re-activates a long-standing pattern of seeking external validation and struggling with self-worth, which appears to be contingent on achievement and external approval rather than an intrinsic sense of value. Her mother’s actions (“She really believes that everyone else believes that you’re a reflection of her”) highlight a pathological enmeshment that stifles Caitlin’s autonomy and authentic self-expression.

Caitlin’s primary challenge lies in establishing and maintaining firm interpersonal boundaries, particularly with her mother. She articulates her frustrations but struggles to translate them into effective assertive behaviors. Her pattern of “overthinking” social situations (e.g., friend group dynamics, engagement party invitations) suggests a combination of anxiety, a desire to manage others’ perceptions, and a tendency to internalize external pressures. This difficulty with boundaries extends to her social relationships, where she struggles to assert her preferences without feeling “weird” or “guilty.” The therapist’s observation that Caitlin sets “requests” rather than “boundaries” is a clinically salient point, indicating a need for explicit skill-building in interpersonal effectiveness.

From an ACT perspective, Caitlin exhibits significant psychological inflexibility, particularly in her fusion with unhelpful thoughts (“overthinking,” self-shaming about sleep) and experiential avoidance of difficult emotions (frustration, anger towards mother). Her values, implicitly expressed through her desire for authenticity, autonomy, and not having “regrets,” are being undermined by her current behavioral patterns and external pressures. From a Narrative Therapy lens, her mother’s narrative of what Caitlin “should” be doing (career, wedding planning) is attempting to dominate Caitlin’s own emerging narrative of self-determination and professional identity. The current stressors, while distressing, offer a critical opportunity for Caitlin to define her non-negotiables and re-author her life story in alignment with her authentic values.
