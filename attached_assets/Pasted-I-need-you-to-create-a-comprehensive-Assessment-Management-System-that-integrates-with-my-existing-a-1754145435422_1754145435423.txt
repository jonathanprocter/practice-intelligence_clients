I need you to create a comprehensive Assessment Management System that integrates with my existing application. Here are the requirements:

## 1. Create a New Tab/Section
- Add a new tab called "Assessments" to the main navigation
- This tab should be accessible from the main dashboard
- Include an icon (clipboard or checklist icon) for the tab

## 2. Assessment Management Interface
Create an assessment management page with:
- A list view showing all available assessments
- Categories/tags for different assessment types (intake, progress, outcome measures, etc.)
- Search and filter functionality
- Ability to assign assessments to specific clients
- Status indicators (not started, in progress, completed)

## 3. Assessment Integration Structure
Build a system that can:
- Store assessment URLs (I will provide these)
- Embed assessments in iframes or modal windows
- Track which assessments are assigned to which clients
- Monitor completion status

## 4. Real-Time Data Capture
Implement functionality to:
- Capture form responses as clients complete them
- Auto-save progress every 30 seconds
- Show a progress indicator
- Validate required fields before submission
- Handle multiple assessment formats (Google Forms, Typeform, custom forms, etc.)

## 5. Client Record Integration
Create a system that:
- Links assessment results to specific client profiles
- Stores responses in a structured format (JSON)
- Timestamps all submissions
- Allows viewing of historical assessment data
- Generates summary reports

## 6. Calendar/Appointment Integration
Build features to:
- Link assessments to specific appointments on the calendar
- Auto-populate assessment results into session notes
- Create templates for progress notes that include assessment data
- Show assessment status in the appointment view
- Send assessment links before appointments (optional)

## 7. Database Schema
Create tables/collections for:
- assessments (id, name, url, type, category, description)
- client_assessments (id, client_id, assessment_id, appointment_id, status, assigned_date, completed_date)
- assessment_responses (id, client_assessment_id, responses_json, timestamp)
- assessment_scores (id, client_assessment_id, score_type, score_value, interpretation)

## 8. UI Components Needed:
- Assessment assignment modal
- Progress tracking dashboard
- Results viewer with graphs/charts
- Print-friendly reports
- Bulk assignment interface

## 9. API Endpoints:
- POST /api/assessments/assign
- GET /api/assessments/client/:clientId
- POST /api/assessments/responses/save
- GET /api/assessments/results/:assessmentId
- PUT /api/assessments/complete
- GET /api/appointments/:appointmentId/assessments

## 10. Security Requirements:
- Ensure HIPAA compliance
- Encrypt assessment responses
- Implement access controls (only assigned clinician can view)
- Audit trail for all assessment activities
- Secure iframe implementation if embedding external forms

## 11. Features for Session Notes:
- Auto-populate assessment scores into SOAP notes
- Create assessment summary sections
- Link to full assessment results
- Track changes over time
- Generate outcome tracking graphs

## 12. Additional Features:
- Email/SMS reminders for incomplete assessments
- Batch printing of assessment results
- Export to PDF functionality
- Integration with billing (CPT codes for assessments)
- Customizable assessment packages (groups of assessments)

Please create this system with a clean, professional UI that matches the existing application design. Use React components if the app is React-based, and ensure all data is properly validated and sanitized before storage. Include error handling and loading states for all operations.

After you build the base structure, I will provide the assessment URLs to populate the system.
