Comprehensive Clinical Progress Note for Amberly Comeau’s Therapy Session on August 4, 2025

Subjective:
Amberly attended today’s session reporting that she has been feeling “low key, pretty chill” overall, but noted multiple interpersonal stressors and situational frustrations. She described a recent abrupt change in communication with her father following his therapy session, speculating that his therapist may have advised him to avoid discussing certain topics with her. Amberly expressed ambivalence—acknowledging that partial insight into his perspectives was helpful but also wanting to avoid situations where he might feel attacked. She also reported challenges with her father’s partner and recounted frustrations about perceived lack of transparency regarding his social plans.

Amberly discussed ongoing tensions with Diana’s sister, a figure she perceives as phony and intermittently hostile. She described multiple past incidents of perceived jealousy and verbal aggression from this person, including a text message mistakenly sent to Amberly calling her “the biggest bitch in the world.” While noting that she tries to disengage rather than react, Amberly admitted feeling apprehensive about attending the sister’s upcoming 30th birthday party due to anticipated alcohol and drug use in that social circle. She described recent recommitment to not drinking, citing concerns about weight, body image, and overall wellness, and connected this decision to improved mental clarity during a prior period of abstinence.

She also detailed a stressful encounter at a family barbecue, including a hurtful comment from her grandfather suggesting that her relationship with Brian might end because she “fights with everybody.” Amberly described feeling singled out and nitpicked by multiple family members during the event, escalating her frustration. She reported using humor and avoidance to deflect but also admitted to lingering irritation and emotional exhaustion after the gathering.

Amberly provided an update on Brian’s health, noting that he has been seizure-free for approximately six weeks and is preparing to start a Master’s program in elementary education. He has also applied for disability benefits, which she understands may be a lengthy process. Amberly reflected on her own shift in anxiety management regarding his health, sharing that she feels more supported since living at home and is less hypervigilant than in the past. She also expressed relief and increased acceptance about the possibility of surgical intervention following a neurosurgical consult later this month.

Objective:
Amberly presented casually dressed, with normal grooming and hygiene. She was alert, oriented, and engaged throughout the session, with clear, spontaneous speech. Affect was moderately variable—expansive and animated when describing humorous or sarcastic moments, but constricted and tense when recounting interpersonal conflicts. She maintained good eye contact and exhibited appropriate gestural emphasis to underscore points. Her tone shifted toward defensiveness and irritation when recalling perceived slights from family members, and became lighter, even playful, when discussing Brian’s progress or her own wellness goals. Thought processes were linear and goal-directed, though tangential at times when recounting multiple storylines. No psychotic features observed. Insight into interpersonal dynamics was fair; judgment appeared intact.

Assessment:
Amberly presents with ongoing relational stressors, boundary challenges, and situational triggers for frustration that align with patterns of interpersonal sensitivity and assertive communication struggles. Her recent stability in mood appears linked to intentional health behaviors (e.g., alcohol cessation) and positive developments in her partner’s health and academic trajectory. She demonstrates increased capacity for self-regulation in certain contexts, such as disengaging from provocative individuals, yet remains emotionally impacted by perceived criticism from family members.

From a therapeutic framework, Amberly exhibits a blend of experiential avoidance and selective engagement: she withdraws from toxic dynamics to preserve emotional energy but continues to ruminate afterward. Narrative identity themes suggest a tension between her desire for autonomy and the impact of others’ perceptions on her self-concept. There is also evidence of body image-related cognitive distortions and susceptibility to social comparison, which may exacerbate self-criticism.

Diagnosis (working):

Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood (F43.23) – ongoing, related to interpersonal and family-of-origin conflicts.

Rule out Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1).

Partner’s chronic health condition contributing to situational stress.

Plan:
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Interventions: Continue work on differentiating between “clean” and “dirty” discomfort in interpersonal exchanges. Support Amberly in recognizing when rumination is amplifying distress beyond the initial trigger. Introduce defusion exercises to reduce fusion with judgmental thoughts about herself after conflicts.

Narrative Therapy Elements: Externalize the “family scapegoat” narrative, reframing her identity within family systems to reduce internalization of criticism. Facilitate exploration of counter-stories highlighting moments when she successfully navigated family dynamics with composure and boundary maintenance.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Skills: Reinforce interpersonal effectiveness strategies for managing high-conflict interactions, particularly DEAR MAN and GIVE skills. Integrate mindfulness of current emotion and urge-surfing techniques for real-time conflict de-escalation.

Behavioral Activation: Encourage continued engagement in health-supportive behaviors (walking, non-alcoholic socializing, and cannabis edibles as a harm reduction approach). Schedule one mastery activity and one pleasure activity each day, regardless of mood.

Next Session Focus: Review Brian’s neurosurgical consult outcome, process any anxiety related to it, and revisit Amberly’s experiences at upcoming social events for application of boundary and mindfulness strategies.

Supplemental Analyses:

Tonal Analysis:
Shift 1 – Neutral to Irritated: Occurred when recalling her grandfather’s comment suggesting Brian might leave her due to her being argumentative. Tone became sharper, with clipped phrasing and raised volume, reflecting an acute emotional wound tied to perceived injustice and invalidation.
Shift 2 – Irritated to Playful: When describing Brian’s school enrollment and financial aid success, tone softened, cadence became more relaxed, and affect brightened, indicating genuine pride and relief in his progress.

Thematic Analysis:
Theme 1 – Perceived Injustice and Mischaracterization: Amberly’s narratives reflect sensitivity to being misunderstood or labeled negatively, particularly in family settings. These incidents appear to activate core schemas around fairness and belonging.
Theme 2 – Boundary Negotiation and Self-Preservation: Recurrent descriptions of disengaging from conflict highlight a protective strategy to limit emotional harm, though residual rumination suggests incomplete resolution of distress.

Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiments About Self – Mixed: Expressions of self-criticism related to weight gain and body image (“bloated,” “gross”) contrast with self-affirmation in moments of behavioral success (maintaining alcohol abstinence).
Sentiments About Others – Predominantly Critical: Directed toward individuals perceived as manipulative, phony, or hostile. Interwoven with pockets of warmth and gratitude when describing supportive relationships (e.g., with Brian).

Key Points:
• Amberly is in a period of relative mood stability, aided by intentional lifestyle adjustments and positive partner-related developments.
• Ongoing sensitivity to perceived criticism remains a treatment focus, especially in high-intensity family interactions.
• Skills reinforcement for conflict navigation and rumination reduction will be key to sustaining gains.

Significant Quotes:
“He’s having like, this grand old time… just having fun with her.” – Reflects projection of concerns about lack of transparency in her father’s relationship.
“I just walk away. I ignore her. I don’t give her that reaction.” – Demonstrates adaptive disengagement as a conflict management strategy.
“I feel bloated and gross and like my face… I want to go back to what I was doing.” – Captures self-critical body image thoughts driving behavior change motivation.

Comprehensive Narrative Summary:
In today’s session, Amberly presented with a complex interplay of relational tension, self-regulatory successes, and emerging resilience. Her recounting of interpersonal conflicts—with family, acquaintances, and her father’s partner—revealed an enduring sensitivity to perceived slights and a strong sense of justice, which fuels both her frustration and her disengagement strategies. She is actively working to maintain sobriety from alcohol, motivated by both physical health concerns and a desire to sustain the mental clarity she experienced during prior abstinence.

The session also explored shifting dynamics in her relationship with Brian, whose seizure-free status, academic advancement, and disability application represent stabilizing influences in Amberly’s environment. This stability appears to have reduced her hypervigilance regarding his health, allowing for increased emotional space to focus on her own wellbeing.

Amberly’s family-of-origin interactions continue to serve as a key site of therapeutic intervention, given their capacity to trigger both defensive anger and post-event rumination. Her ability to disengage in the moment without escalation is a noted strength, though lingering emotional residue suggests the need for expanded skills in processing and releasing these interactions.

Therapeutic efforts will continue to integrate ACT, DBT, and narrative strategies to reinforce psychological flexibility, enhance boundary setting, and challenge internalized negative self-narratives. The overarching goal remains to support Amberly in sustaining behavioral gains, expanding her repertoire of conflict management strategies, and developing a more stable and internally anchored sense of self-worth.
