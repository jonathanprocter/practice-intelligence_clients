Here's how you can significantly improve the layout and formatting of your Assessment Management Tab to provide a professional, intuitive, and efficient workflow for clinicians and clients:

Design & Layout Recommendations
1. Top-Level Navigation Structure
Use a multi-tab or left sidebar layout, clearly labeled for:

Assessment Catalog

Assigned Assessments

Assessment Bundles

Live Session Mode

Progress Notes/Integration

On wide screens, a left sidebar is more efficient for rapid navigation; use tabs or drawers for mobile.

2. Sticky Header & Context
Sticky Header shows:

Current client/session (with picture/avatar if possible)

Date/time of session

Quick actions: “Assign”, “Start Live”, “Add Note”

Breadcrumb or mini-tabs for “In Session”, “History”, etc.

3. Catalog Tab
Table/List View of all available assessments:

Columns: Name | Description | Time | Type | Assign | Preview

Each row has an “Assign” button (modal pops up for client selection and settings) and a “Preview” icon.

Each assessment should show a small tag or badge for type (e.g., "Personality", "Values", "Relationship").

4. Assigned Assessments Tab
Cards or Table per Assigned Assessment:

Columns/fields: Name | Assigned To | Status (Not Started / In Progress / Done) | Assigned Date | Last Completed | Link to Progress Note | “Start/Continue” button

Expandable row/card for quick view of score/status/detail and “Mark Complete” or “Open in Session”

5. Bundles Tab
Accordion list or cards for each bundle/package:

Bundle title, description, number of included tools

Expand shows contained assessments and status for client

“Assign Entire Bundle” button, “View Progress” for details

6. Live Session Mode
Prominent Start Banner (sticky at top):

“Start New Live Assessment Session” button

In-session timer (optional), “Save Progress”, “End Session”

Stepwise Panel UI:

Current Assessment displayed center stage (iframe/embed or modal)

Live progress sidebar shows order/completion status of all planned assessments in the session

Contextual Controls:

“Skip”, “Pause”, “Attach Note”, “Link to Session” on every assessment

7. Assessment History/Progress Notes
Timeline View or Table:

Show all past completed assessments, clear mapping to appointments/notes.

Click to view assessment results inline, or jump to full assessment review.

8. Visual/Styling Tips
Prefer cards and soft containers (not just raw tables!) for user focus.

Use color-coding/tagging by assessment type (e.g., blue for cognitive, green for personality, purple for values).

Use clear, intuitive icons (info, assign, preview, complete) with accessible labels.

Maintain generous spacing/whitespace, large touch targets, and modern fonts.

Sticky “Help/FAQ” floating button with quick links to documentation or video guide.

9. Accessibility & Responsive
Shade rows/cards for hover/focus, not just checkboxes.

Provide alternate text for every icon, ARIA landmarks for all panels, and fully responsive for all devices.

Always provide both keyboard and mouse/touch navigation.

Summary Example Layout:

text
 --------------------------------------------------------
| [Back to Dashboard] | [Current Session: John Smith ☑]  |
 --------------------------------------------------------
| Sidebar            |  [Sticky Controls & Quick Links]  |
| - Catalog          | [Assign] [Start Live] [Add Note]  |
| - Assigned         |-----------------------------------|
| - Bundles          |  Assessment Catalog (Table/List)   |
| - Live Session     |-----------------------------------|
| - Notes            |  [Assessment Cards/History Table]  |
 --------------------------------------------------------
Key Principles:

Make navigation between catalog, assignment, bundle, session, and note seamless.

Highlight what’s “in progress” and “next up” for the client/session.

Use cards and sidebars for context—not just stacks of tables.
