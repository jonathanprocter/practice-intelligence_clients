 * Multi-Session Document Processing Test
 * 
 * This script demonstrates the enhanced document processing system that:
 * 1. Detects multi-session documents (like the Caitlin Dunn comprehensive progress notes)
 * 2. Parses individual sessions with dates and content
 * 3. Creates appointments if they don't exist
 * 4. Attaches preformatted progress notes to appointments
 * 5. Maintains therapeutic participation logs

    Session 1 - July 15, 2025
    ========================
    
    Comprehensive Clinical Progress Note
    
    Client: Caitlin Dunn
    Date: July 15, 2025
    Session Type: Individual Therapy
    Duration: 60 minutes
    
    Subjective:
    Caitlin presented today discussing ongoing anxiety related to work transitions. She reports feeling "overwhelmed" by recent changes in her role and expresses concerns about meeting expectations. Sleep patterns remain disrupted (4-5 hours per night), and she notes increased caffeine intake to compensate for fatigue.
    
    Objective:
    Client appeared alert and engaged throughout the session. Maintained appropriate eye contact. Speech was rapid at times, consistent with reported anxiety. No signs of acute distress observed.
    
    Assessment:
    Caitlin continues to demonstrate symptoms consistent with adjustment disorder with anxiety. Progress noted in identifying trigger patterns, though coping strategies need reinforcement. Client shows good insight into her current challenges.
    
    Plan:
    1. Continue weekly individual therapy sessions
    2. Practice grounding techniques discussed today
    3. Implement sleep hygiene recommendations
    4. Follow up on work-related stressors next session

    Subjective:
    Caitlin reports improvement in sleep quality following implementation of sleep hygiene techniques. Still experiencing work-related anxiety but notes using grounding techniques "helped twice this week." Expresses interest in exploring assertiveness skills for workplace communication.
    
    Objective:
    Client appeared more relaxed than previous session. Speech pace normalized. Demonstrated understanding of coping strategies through examples. Active participation in session planning.
    
    Assessment:
    Positive response to behavioral interventions. Anxiety symptoms showing gradual improvement. Client is developing better self-awareness and coping mechanisms. Ready to progress to skill-building phase.
    
    Plan:

    2. Assign practice exercises for workplace communication
    3. Monitor sleep patterns and anxiety levels
    4. Consider gradual exposure techniques for work situations
